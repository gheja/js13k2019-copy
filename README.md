This is a dummy repository to have my commits appear on my activity page,
as I used an invalid e-mail address (user@hostname) while working on the
js13k entry and now GitHub requires the e-mail address to be a valid
routable one when adding to the profile, even GitHub Support could not
overcome this.

As I have referenced the commits outside the repository and the js13k
organizer forked my project I wasn't able to update the e-mail addresses
used in the commits as it needs history rewriting and that changes commit
ids.

This is the solution I came up with to have my commits count and keep the
external links consistent.
